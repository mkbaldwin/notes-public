### Session 1: Security Vulnerabilities

Joe Kunk

 * Risk = Event Probability x Business Impact
 * Attacks tend to fall into a small number of categories
 * fireeye.com
 * Bring your own device (BYOD)
   * More Challenges for Security
 * Devices that can impersonate an open access point. Then capture all data then
   relay to the real device. Thus allowing someone to capture all traffic including
   SSL keys.
    * Mitigate with VPN client
 * Ransomware - Encrypt data and then hold the keys for ransom
   * getting much smarter
   * very dangerous
   * These are a business. Demand payment in BitCoin. Even have "customer support"
     to help people pay.
   * 3X more ransomware apps for mobile devices in the past year.
   * Recent offline backup (physical disconnect) are only real protection
 * Most attacks are random and not targeted at anyone specific
   * Throw it out and see who they catch
 * Attack types
   * SQL Injection
     * Most common
     * Easy fix
   * Cross site scripting (XSS)
   * Cross site request forgery (CSRF)
