### KeyNote: Mixed Paradigms - The Method to Madness

Venkat Subramaniam 

  * We are problem solvers (some of us create more problems than we solve).
  * What's a language
    * A communication tool
    * Convey ideas to computers and to other people
    * A form of expression
  * Turing completeness doesn't cover everything about a programming language
  * All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection - David Wheeler
  * Misguided conversation - Object oriented vs functional
    * Real question - Imperitave vs Declarative
    * Imperative -> Tell what and how
    * Declarative -> Tell what to do now how to do it
  * Functional programming is declarative + higher order functions
  * Imperative style is easy to write, but hard to read
  * Functional style is easy to read, but hard to write (partly unfamiliarity)
  * Imperative gets progressively harder (as the problem gets more complicated)
  * Which is the right approach? 
    * We have an imperative-functional duality
    * Maybe languages are hybrids for a good reason
  * Imperative is good at dealing with side-effects and exceptions
  * A pure function doesn't change anything, and **should not depend on anything that could possibly change**.
  * Functional is good at scale, parallelization, reasoning
    * Functional code is easier to parallelize
  * Languages should enable and not limit our form of expressions
  * "Wisdom is realizing that there are no absolutes"
