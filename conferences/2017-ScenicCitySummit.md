## Opening Keynote: The Reusable Javascript Revolution

Cory House

  * Sturgeons Law -> 90% of everything is crap
  * Three Revolutions
    1. NPM Packages
    2. Starter Kits 
    3. Components
  * Starter Kits
    * Too Many Decisions
    * Vanilla.js is malpractice
    * Manual setup of a new project is too much work.
    * A starter kit is an automated checklist.
    * Take an existing starter kit and make it your own.
    * react-slingshot 
  * Reusable Components
    * The modern dev shop is becoming an assembler of components.
    * Web Components
      * Not widely supported
      * Need polyfills currently
    * What to look for with a framework
      * Stability
      * Broad Adoption
      * Low Boilerplate
      * Lightweight
    * > Strong Opinions Weakly Held"
    * Component design is HARD.
    * Component coding is easy.
    
 > The future is here, its just not evenly distributed.
 
## Session 1: A Maze of Twisty Little Passages

Emily Estes

  * Inform 7 -> Language for writing text adventure games.
  
## Session 2: Tame the frontend with Elm

Jeremy Fairbank (@elpapapollo)

  * No runtime exceptions in practice
  * No undefined
  * Fast
  * One Framework
    * Model-View-Update Pattern
  * Functional
    * Creating a function
      ```elm
      greet name = "Hello, " ++ name
      ```
    * Calling a function
      ```elm
      greet "Someone"
      ```
    * Pure Functions
      * No Side Effects
      * Output only depends on input
      * Predictable and Testable
    * Elm is declarative instead of imperative
    * Curried Functions
      ```elm
      (add 1) 2
      ```
      New function created for the each parameter.
    * Pipes -> Compose functions with expressive chaining
    * `|>` Pipe Operator - used for composing
      ```elm
      excitedGreeting name = 
        name
           |> String.toUpper
           |> greet
           |> exclaim
      ```
  * Strong static types
    * Can be inferred or Specified.
      * `isTrue : Bool`
      * `numbers : List Int` (type variable)
    Types for functions
      * `greet : String -> String`
      * `add : Int -> Int -> Int`
  * Immutable Data
    * All types are immutable
  * Record
    * Similar to Objects
      ```elm
        dog: {name : String, age : Int}
        dog = {
          name = "Something"
          age - 4
        }
      ``` 
    * Accessing Properties
      * `dog.age`
    * Record update syntax
      ```elm
      haveBirthday dog = 
        {dog | age = dog.age + 1}
      ```
      Copies all fields that aren't overriden
  * Custom Types
    * Alias Type
      ```elm
      type alias Dog = {
        name : String,
        age : Int,
        breed : Breed
      }
      ```
    * Union Type (kind of like enum)
      ```elm
      type Breed = Sheltie | Poodle
      ```
  * No null or undefined
    * "Maybe" type
  * Elm Architecture
    * *Model -> View -> Messages -> Update -> Model*
    * Model -> Data
    * View -> Render Visually
    * Messages -> Event Generated By The View
    * Update -> Take messages and update the model
    * Data always flows in one direction. No two-way data binding.
    * VDOM - Virtual Representation of the DOM
    
## Session 3: Learn React Before Lunch

Cory House

  * codesandbox.io
    * Specific to React
  * JSX
    * Basically HTML
    * className instead of class
    * htmlFor instead of for
  * create-react-app
    * Facebook's recommended way to get started
  * Can create components using a function or class
    * Function is preferred
  * Navigation.js
    ```javascript
    function Navigation() {
      return (
        some HTML
      )
    }
    
    export default Navigation;
    ```
  * `import Navigation from './Navigation`;
  * Can now use `<Navigation />`
  * JavaScript in JSX needs to be in curly braces
  * Props are passed into the function as a props variable
  * Can use JavaScript to write css for components
    * Can use JS variables
    * Can put in shared location in another JS file
  
## Session 4: Android Rx Java

Andrew May

  * Native first - cross platform second
  * > If you think good architecture is expensive try bad Architecture
    - Brian Foote & Joseph Yoder
  * Rx Java (functional programming)
    * Classes for representing data sources
    * Classes for responding to data sources
  * Streams are the main concept. Think reactively.
  * Observable & Observer
  *Backpressure
    * slow things down
  * Observable
    * Handling GUI Events
    * Similar to Iterable
    * Emits an item
    * Doesn't begin emitting until an observable subscribes
  * Observer
    * Assigned to an observable with subscribe()
    * Reacts when data is emitted
  * Real world uses
    * Network Communication
    * DB Calls
    * Hooks into UI
    * What do you need to stream?
  * Retrofit -> Network API Library for Android
    * Non android too?
  * Observable -> Emit
  * Observer -> Watch
  * Pay attention to backpressure
  * Think functional
