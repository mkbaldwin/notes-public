# Session 2: This just isn't working (on my machine): Navigating the arranged marriage of dev and QA

Katie Cleveland | @qualitykt

  * QA vs Developers
    * QA can feel like it is not playing on the same team
  * QA does more than just test
  * QA
    * They want to understand, but may not have the same technical background.
  * QA is a different skillset from developers. Different perspective.
  * Create a personal relationship
    * Personal relationships build trust, and enables productivity
    * Helps with moments of frustration
    * Next time you have to communicate do so in person (or video call if remote)
    * Ability to ask for help
    * Ability to discuss frustrations
    * Easier to deliver feedback
  * Communicate more
    * Be mindful of how you do it...
    * How do we both get what we need without driving each other crazy? Pomodoro technique
    * Discuss terminology
  * Create better documentation for everyone's sake and work together on it
    * Dev should update the ticket to mention any outliers they think of to help QA
  * Have a bug/feature template
  * What if we miss things?
    * We are humans and make mistakes
    * We win as a team, and lose as a team
    * Don't point fingers
    * QA finding defects isn't personal, it is their job
