# The 7 Pillar Developer: Lifestyle Systems for the Exceptional Developer

Cory House / @housecor / reactjsconsulting.com

  * Success is personal
    * Everyone has a different definition
  * Assumption: Being a better geek will make you better at your goal.
  * Quote: Hunter S. Thompson (lookup quote he used in presentation | https://twitter.com/stevealbers/status/1116712907813863425?s=21)
  * Pillar #1: Psychology
    * The happiness advantage (book)
    * Stress reduces: creativity, cooperation
    * Happiness Chemicals
      * Endorphins -> Exercise
      * Dopamine -> Complete a task
      * Seratonin -> Help others
      * Oxytocin -> Time with loved ones
    * If you are feeling depressed/down you are probably short on one of these chemicals.
    * Can be addictive
  * Pillar #2: Focus
    * Specialize -> Be remarkable
    * "I want to be exceptional at __________"
      * Greater focus = higher risk, higher reward
      * Specialization becomes a necessity as industries mature
      * "We're all nailing jello to the wall. Its all moving too quickly." 
    * What would people type in to google to find you? Its probably not "developer", it has to be more specific.
    * Going pro is about focus.
  * Pillar #3: Education
    * Fixed vs Growth Mindset
    * If something is hard it just means you have to work harder.
    * Focus on just-in-time learning, not just-in-case learnining.
    * Information
      * Know what to ignore
      * 90% of everything is crap - Sturgeon's Law
      * github.com/coryhouse/ama -> His information stream
      * Learn how you learn. Not everyhting works for everyone.
      * We pay others to teach. Why?
        You're buying time, motivation, shared team experience.
      * The Feynman Technique
        * Describe what you are trying to learn as if you were trying to describe it to a child.
        * Learn one thing at a time.
      * Virtual Brain
        * Evernote
        * One Note
        * Github/Gists
        * "Create your own haystack"
          * Quotes
          * Article Summaries
          * Book Notes
  * Pillar #4: Image
    * How other people perceive you.
    * Coding -> Dress for comfort
    * Consulting -> Dress for power
    * People do judge a book by its cover.
    * Improve Self-Image
      * "I am who you think I am"
    * Learn, write, teach, code, speak In Public
    * Image isn't about ego, it's about opportunity.
      * Book: Ego is the Enemy
    * Increase your luck surface area
  * Pillar #5: Communication
    * Stereotype: We're poor communicators
    * To be an expert be the person asking the right questions.
    * We're all selling ideas
      * Book: To sell is human
    * Argument -> When you try to decide **who** is right
    * Discussion -> When you try to decide **what** is right
    * Keep your identity small
      * Avoid: "I am a react developer"
      * Instead: "I currently specialize in react"
    * Talk money, but not with co-workers.
    * Networking
      * Conferences: Sit down with people you don't know. Don't sit with your co-workers.
      * Be real. Network with people you like.
      * Be genuine.
  * Pillar #6: Time
    * We all have the same 24 hours in the day.
      * Not exactly. Money buys time.
    * Money buys mental bandwidth
      * e.g. setting bills to autopay
    * Try not to increase your lifestyle, increase your freedom
    * Multithread your life -> Accomplish multiple things at the same time
      * Learn while commuting
      * Learn while exercising
    * Think about systems instead of goals
      * Goals have an endpoint, but systems don't

Note: Apparently I got one of the pillars mixed in with the others rather than noting it separately.
