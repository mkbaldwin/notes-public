# Cognative Biases and the User Experience

Andrew Malek / @malekontheweb / UI Developer & Designer

  * Cognative bias -> A type of error in thinking, often a result of your brain attempting to simplifying information
  * Lots of biases occur in web design
  * False consensus effect -> overestimating how many people will think like you
    * "If I was in their shoes I wouldn't have done that..."
    * You are not the user. Must assume we are different from our users.
    * Anything you assume about the end user must be tested
    * UX testing participants should come from a variety of backgrounds
  * Curse of Knowledge -> individual communicating with others automatically assumes a level of background knowledge
    * "Never use a long word when a dimunitive one will do" - William Safire
  * Confirmation Bias -> Looking for information (unintentionally) that is consistent with our beliefs
    * Can impact A/B testing
    * User feedback can fuel this
      * You do a test and get 9s and 10s on your survey. 
        * Did the users even notice the changes?
        * What if they liked a different change that slipped in.
        * They may just be polite.
      * IKEA Effect -> Time spend helping create the product makes you tend to like it more.
        * Build-a-bear workshop, LEGO, Subway, etc
    * "When we emotionally invest ourselves in our work we run the risk of being unable to see its flaws."
  * Framing Bias -> How we present options/words can impact results
    * "How did the new search box make it easier for you to search?"
      * Leading (framing) question
      * Biases the survey
    * Reporting
      * How you present results can impact how people will make decisions
        * "4 participants tried the new search box" vs "26 participants tried the new search box"
  * Bike shed effect
    * Parkinson's law of triviality -> Tendency to focus on trivial items and ignore the big picture
    * Meetings
      * Ensure decision maker is there
      * Set agenda before hand
      * Timebox discussion
  * Action Bias -> Tendency to think that value can only be realized from action
  * Bandwagon effect -> People jump in and do the same thing because other people are doing it7
