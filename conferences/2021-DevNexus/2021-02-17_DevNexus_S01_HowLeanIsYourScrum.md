# Virtual Session 1: How lean is your scrum?

Leigh Griffin / RedHat / @leighgriffin

 * Scrum adaptations are normal
 * Lean
   * Origins at Toyota
   * Philosophy not a framework
   * Most successful when viewed as a philosophy/culture
   * 8 Wastes of Lean viewed through Scrum
     * Waste
       * Defects/bugs
       * Additional work on a product or service
       * Scrum struggles to handle inflight bugs/prod support
       * The unknown unknows cause the biggest problems for scrum
       * Requirements challenge
         * Go too deep it's not agile
         * Not deep enough, increased defects
     * Waiting
       * QA waiting for things from dev
       * Sprint is a batch
       * Definiton of done hampers flow. 
       * Early and often feedback is valuable but causes rework
       * Skills matrix -> Can result in idle team members
     * Transportation
       * Non value add movement of material or prople
       * Causes: Large batches or complex processes
       * Automation is an afterthought generally
         * Manually moving code through environments
     * Motion
       * Movement or action of people that doesn't add value
       * Whole team meeting attendance
         * 90% are passive listeners
         * big problem for remote: distractions
       * Context Switching
         * Switching from coding, to reviewing, to testing
         * WiP Limits not enforced
         * 33% loss in productivity trying to achieve 50/50 split
     * Overproduction
       * Worst kind of problem Causes other problems
       * Producing faster than required/needed
       * Causes: unbalanced teams, forecasting techniques off
       * Customers don't always want code that quickly
         * Change too quick, quality issues
       * Team ratios are off. Typical 5:1 ratio of envineer to QA
       * Estimates - Rarely to teams complete what they commit to
     * Inventory
       * Stock not being used in JIT manner
       * Issues of flow through system
       * Scrum - backlog is inventory
         * Little's law - Throughput = WiP/Cycle Time
         * Doesn't sound very agile
         * Partialy done work/incomplete items from sprint put into backlog
       * Poor flow due to WiP limits
     * Extra processing
       * Long term maintenance
         * Not handled well by scrum
         * Artifacts need to be generated for maintenance
         * Software isn't made in a silo where we build it and never see it again
         * Proactive response vs reactive response (firedrill)
     * Unused Talent
       * Not in toyota system
       * Separation of managers & employees
       * Lack of challenges
       * Ridid company policy
       * Scrum
         * Doesn't recognize manager role
         * Lack of day-to-day pulse for guidance / career changes
         * Scrum by the books - Stay on the tracks and you'll get there. 
           * Missing out ... agile is rich and teams should look that direction
         * **Work handed down vs bubbled up**
 * Lean tools and approaches you can apply
   * Embrace kanban
     * Set WiP limits
     * Pull from the right (in progress) before the backlog to increase flow
   * Scrum Ceremony
     * Lots of idle people
     * Can you streamline?
   * Backlog review.
     * Cap with WiP
     * Force the value conversations
   * Empower your team
     * Innovate, influence your backlog
     * Get maintenance, bugs, technical debt off your backlog first.
