# DevNexus 2020 - Day 2

## Keynote 2 - Quantum Computing

Jessica Pointing, Stanford - @jessicapointing

  * Quantum Physics
  * Quantum computer uses the behaviors of quantum physics to do computation.
  * What is the potential of quantum computing?
    * Factoring/search
      * Factoring a 617 digit number on a classical computer could take up to 1 billion years, but on a quantum computer it would only take 100 seconds.
      * How do we know this is possible? People come up with quantum algorithm. 
      * Unstructured search
    * Understanding Nature
      * Use a quantum system to simulate and understand a quantum system (nature)
      * Applications for: Medicine, Materials, etc.
    * Machine Learning 
  * Programming a Quantum Computer
    * Quantum Bit - Quibit
      * Classical bit, 0 or 1
      * Represented as vectors
      * Superposition, both 0 and 1 at the same time. 
    * Quantum Gates
      * The equivilent of traditional logic gates
      * Strange - Quantum Computing API for Java
      * github.com/johanvos/quantumjava
  * Progress
    * Hardware
      * How to build a quantum computer?
        * Superconductors (most popular right now)
        * Trapped Ions
        * Photons
        * Diamonds
        * + Others
      * We have actually built quantum computers
      * Largest quantum computers have 50 - 100 quibits.
    * Opportunity for developers
    * Anyone has access to quantum hardware through the cloud
    *
