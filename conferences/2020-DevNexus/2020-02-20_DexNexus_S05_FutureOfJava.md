## Is Java still relevant?
  * Short answer, yes.
  * Java like most good languages is evolving. 
  * The faster release cadence and more languages in the JVM ecosystem has resulted in more innovation.
  * It's not just about the language, but about the whole JVM ecosystem. Lots of libraries and tools that have been created in the last 25 years.
  * So many applications out there (legacy applications). Language selection isnt reversable, or is hard to change.
  * Java isn't a system where it says this is the only way to do things. Able to mix and match different languages on the JVM.
  * Is Java even taught in colleges? Colleges respond to the market. GA Tech uses Java as the core of their education.
  * Doesn't force you to compromise. Can use cutting edge new features along with legacy support.
    
## We often see trends in "coolness". Do students see Java still as "cool"?
  * The new features and capabilities are "cool".
  * It is always about marketing. Prooving you are solving a problem in a good way.
  * I want Students to be as confused as they can be when they leave because that's how I am when I am at work. - Venkat
  * Shouldn't teach that there is only one way to solve a problem.
  * When people don't find something cool we aren't showing them the right stuff.
  * Once you have to do something on a job, coolness might not be the best way to choose a language.
  * Boring is better then coolness.
  * Java and JavaScript are about the same age, Python is 3 years older than Java.
  * Libraries are available for most things, unlike whatever the new hotness is that may not have as much available.
    
## Why hasn't Java been successful in a field like AI/Machine Learning?
  * Java is great where you want to build a system with a specific structure, reliability, rigor. Machine learning / AI is more of an experimentation. Java doesn't currently work well as a playground like Python.
  * If I am building an enterprise application where security and stability are important I want a language that can help me at compile time. 
  * There is some movement AI/ML in other parts of the JVM ecosystem with other languages that are a bit less verbose.
    
## If I was a new developer straight out of college joining the JVM ecosystem, what is one piece of advice you wish someone had told you?
  * Don't be so focused on the tool that you don't understand what you are trying to do.
  * Understanding the concepts is more important than just how to do it.
  * This is an amazing and frustrating field. You should always try to learn something new every day. The bad news is you are losing ground because so many things are changing.
  * Become exhilirated by the change and learning. 
  * Learn they why and not the how.
  * The worst developers are the ones that go home and think "we got this", we don't.
  * Communication skills are important.
  * Picking your first job... picking based on salary may not be the best way, go somewhere where you can learn and grow.
  * There is an ever expanding amount of information, and it can be hard to determine what to spend hours learning.
  * Have a mentor.
    
## The rate of change, introduction of new tools/frameworks is faster than ever before. How should you determine what to use/learn?
  * I have to say use Spring. - Mark Heckler
  * Find something that excites you.
  * Evaluate, and play around with things. Don't lock yourself into a specific frame of mind.
  * The more tools you have in your toolbox the better prepared you are to handle different problem domains.
  * Use your network, use your colleagues.
  * Someone should be able to say three things they like about something and three things they don't like about it.
  * If 100% of what we learn is 100% of what we use, then we have a problem. I need to have a broad range of knowledge to know what tools to pick for a specific task.
  * There are no silver bullets, there are pros and cons to everything.
  * It's always a good idea to look at new technology, but it isn't always a good idea to apply it.
  * There is no bad learning.
  * Sometimes the weirdest stuff you pick up comes in handy down the line.
  * Development is a team sport.
  * Leverage your team for help.
  
## Is it good or bad that the stewardship of the language rests with one entity?
  * While it is technically true, I don't think one company or person can stomp over everyone.
  * There are lots of players innovating and contributing.
  * The future is brighter than I saw it three years ago.
  * Language features are very rarely planned/created in isolated.
  * The language development process includes feedback.
  
## Are there any features that you would like to see added or taken away with Java?
  * The one I struggle with most is modularity. I hope they keep the "kill switch" for people that don't want to use it.
  * Generics, I don't hate anything in my life as I hate generics. -Venkat
  * Serialization. If I had a time machine I would say "dude don't do this". -Venkat
  * Nullable feature, more predictable way of treating nulls.
  
## Imagine Java isn't relevant, what other language would be taking its place?
  * There are really things Java is good at, but there are others it isn't capable of today.
  * One thing we cannot ignore is webassembly. That will level the playing field. Language won't be the issue because that is the new platform.
  * C#/Microsoft ecosystem or Go
  * I'll take the easy answer, Kotlin! - Mark
  * Maybe something like Rust, but it isn't quite as high-level.
  
## Is the increasing capabilties in Java going to make Kotlin irrelevant?
  * Kotlin has so many capabilities in it, Java will probably never do all of those because it is not practical to do so.
