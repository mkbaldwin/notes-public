  * Three phases...
    * Life as a Developer
    * First time tech lead
    * Wiser tech lead
  * Life as a Developer
    * Measured success by code written and features implemented
    * Want to build more and bigger systems
  * First time tech lead
    * The path is rocky
    * You get to make mistakes but only so many
      * Your mistakes are amplified
    * Common Mistakes
      * Writing code all the time
        * Don't ignore the other responsibilities
      * Making all the technical decisions
        * Might not have all the information
        * Don't take all the interesting challenges away from others.
      * People - that's someone else's problem
        * As a developer you can ignore, but not as a lead
      * Assuming the team knows what they are doing
        * Keep everyone on the same page / goals
      * Don't assume the team will solve problems on their own.
  * Wiser tech lead
    * Be comfortable that things are no longer binary.
      * There aren't always easy/precise answers
    * You don't need to have all the answers
      * It's ok to say "I don't know." then work to figure it out.
    * Your role is not to be liked by everyone
      * You cannot always make everyone happy
      * > If you want to please all you will please none
    * You are not alone
      * You may feel like  a bit of an outsider
    * Non-technical areas are just as important
      * Leadership skills are important
    * People are complex
    * You can't do everything yourself
      * Time management is important
      * Situational Leadership Model
        * Supporting Behavior vs Directing Behavior
          * Tell
          * Sell
          * Participate
          * Delegate
    * There are many ways to be a leader
      * Coach
        * Ask people questions to help lead them to an answer.
        * Help them find their own way.
      * Shepherd
        * Help guide them along the path
      * Shaman
        * Build a story around where it comes from
        * Help people understand why things are the way they are
      * Champion
        * Give the team space
        * Protect them from being interrupted, etc
        * Rally the troops... get everyone focused
      * Many more ways
    * You have a secret power
      * Know how and when to say no.
      * It is easy to take on too much
    * Your role gives you greater impact
    * The journey never ends
