 * Transactional Leadership - rewards/punishment used as motivation
 * Transformational Leadership - charisma and enthusiasm to influence
 * Agile Manifesto
   * 17 people got together to determine if there was a better way to develop software
   * Came up with a set of shared values
   * *Value 1:* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
     * Processes and tools don't build softare you need people who are highly motivated.
     * Preserve dignity at all cost
       * "Coraline community guidelines"
   * *Value 2:* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
     * Does not mean no documentation.
     * Against excessive documentation (documentation that is never read or always out of date).
     * Document only as much as you need.
     * "Working always ships faster than perfect"
   * *Value 3:* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
     * "Customer's trust colleagues not contracts"
     * Not all customers are your friend
   * *Value 4:* **Responding to change** over following a plan
     * The future is difficult to predict
     * Break time down into smaller slices and plan those
     * "Don't fear surprises, fear inflexibility"
   * There is value in the items on the right, but we value the items on the left more.
