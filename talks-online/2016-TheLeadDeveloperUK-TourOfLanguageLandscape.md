  * F#
    * Type Providers
      * Help give the compiler type information
      * Compile time validation
      * No code generation
    * Pipe operator
      * |>
      * Let's us write nested function calls in a pipeline that can be read left to right, top to bottom.
      * Similar to Unix Pipes
      * Also used by Elm and Elixir
    * Unit of Measure
      * Language feature [<Measure>] to let you add contextual information to numeric values.
  * Clojure
    * Homoiconicity
      * Code is data, data is code
    * Macros
  * Rust
    * GC is great, but has runtime cost. Rust provides memory safety without GC.
    * Variables are immutable by default
    * Memory is owned by a variable reference. Which is used to provide the memory safety.
  * Idris
    * Type Driven Development
      * Use types as a way to prove the application will do what you want to do.
      * Dependent Types
  * Learning
    1. Deconstruct the skill
    2. Learn enough to self-correct
    3. Remove practice barriers
    4. Practice at least 20 hours
  * Learn a new paradigm not a new syntax
